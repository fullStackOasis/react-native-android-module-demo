A demo using React-Native with [Android Native Modules](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-android).

[Native modules will be deprecated when the new architecture is "stable"](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-intro), so at that point, this project will either be deprecated or need to be upgraded.

The idea is to use the default React Native example project, and add a native module to it in a way that the module can be used with minimal work. This way, native modules can be demonstrated, but without any complicating factors that might be come from adding a module to an existing, complex project.

The plan is that this native module will be built directly within the project, and will not be distributed as an npm package.

This project will follow the [instructions for native modules](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-android) to start.
